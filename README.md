# Project: The Anime Scout:
## An anime recommendation engine.

#### Ever finished an anime and thought to yourself - "I want to watch that exact anime again, except with different characters and a different story."?

Well, I have! Which is why, I have used collaborative filtering to come up with an anime recommendation engine. I then deployed the project via Streamlit so that I can share my findings with all of you too. The live domain for this website can be found [here](https://share.streamlit.io/statxsphere/anime/explore.py) and due to computational limitations, the full "AniMap" can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/statxsphere/anime/blob/master/AniMap.ipynb). I hope you have fun and find the anime of your dreams!

### Objectives

* To learn the principles behind recommendation engines.
* To explore the data and find inferential insights.
* To help people find the right anime for them.

### Data

The data has been sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist) which was further scraped from the popular website [MyAnimeList](myanimelist.com). A huge shout-out/thank you to both these entities!


### Areas of Improvement

1. Dataset - instead of using a readily available, and more importantly, static dataset, the next step towards improvement is to scrape a more real-time dataset from MAL using their readily available scraper.
2. Modelling - Instead of using just collaborative filtering, finding ways to imbibe elements from content based recommendations would also go a ways in improving the project.
3. Deployment - while Streamlit has been phenomenal for me, to be able to host this project for free, due to the size of the data and computational requirements of the project, I feel it could really do with being deployed in a better manner.

Dattebayo!
